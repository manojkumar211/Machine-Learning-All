# Replace the Null Values:-
```
There are many techniques to replace the null values in Machine Learning. 
Those are:
```
## 1) Fillna():- 
```
By using this method, we can fill the null values with mean, median, mode.
```
## 2) Replace():-
```
By using this method, we can replace the null values with mean, median, mode. which is nothing but similar to the fillna() method.
```
## 3) Interpolation():-
```
By using this method, we can replace the null values with taking help of previous and after values of the null value and replacing with new value. Which is nothing but its going to understand the pattern of the data. So, when we are working on Time Series data there we are using Interpolation technique to replace the null values.
